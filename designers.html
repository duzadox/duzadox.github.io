      <p>Khoon Hooi (full name Lee Khoon Hooi) is one of Malaysia’s top fashion designers who, since launching his eponymous label two decades ago, has won numerous awards, dressed celebrities and the well-heeled, established his own accessories line and, more recently, launched an exclusive jewellery collection with online diamond jeweller Zcova.</p>
      <p>Inspired by his tailor grandmother, with whom he lived while growing up, and who instilled in him an appreciation for beautiful things, Khoon Hooi studied fashion design and graduated from the Malaysian Institute of Art. While working as an assistant designer for women’s fashion label Voir and department store Isetan, he regularly took part in fashion competitions both locally and abroad as a way to hone his skills, and won several awards along the way including the Asian Young Designer award in Japan.</p>
      <p>In 1999, Khoon Hooi founded his self-named label, which became known for its intricate embroidery, high-quality printed fabrics, and feminine silhouettes. A regular participant at Paris Fashion Week and other international fashion trade shows, in 2020, the celebrated couturier and fashion designer achieved yet another milestone when Hollywood celebrities Ginnifer Goodwin, Karen Pittman, Katy Perry, and Zooey Deschanel were spotted in Khoon Hooi creations during awards season.</p>
      <p>In the same year, the style guru made headlines as one of the first fashion designers who volunteered to sew Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for front-liners in the pandemic. He also created an accessories line, Fugeelah, for the namesake social enterprise in collaboration with his friend and Malaysian model Deborah Henry. Any profits from the accessories, which were made entirely from leftover fabrics, were channeled into supporting refugee education at the Fugee School.</p>

      <h3>Bernard Chandran</h3>
      <img src="https://bernardchandran.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/about-img.jpg" alt="Bernard Chandran">
      <p>Bernard Chandran was born in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on February 27, 1968. Growing up in an Islamic country and coming from a mixed parentage background of Indian and Chinese, he was exposed to a rich understanding of cultures from a young age.</p>
      <p>Initially studying accounting, he soon realized that his true passion lay in fashion design. In 1988, he made a career switch and enrolled himself in IFTC (International Fashion Training College), a local fashion college. Recognizing the need to further his career in fashion, he moved to Paris with the support of his then-girlfriend (now wife) and mother.</p>
      <p>In 1993, Bernard Chandran graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Fine Arts from the Paris American Academy and Pattern Making at L'Union Des Chambers Syndicales Parisiennes, Paris. During his time in Paris, he achieved significant recognition, becoming the first non-European designer to win both the coveted Silk Cut Young Designers Award and the Open European contest for Look of the Year 2000 in 1991.</p>
      <p>Paris inspired Bernard and deepened his understanding of his own culture. Upon graduating, he returned to Malaysia with the goal of becoming the "Chanel of Malaysia." In 1994, he introduced a new silhouette and innovative techniques using embellishments and fabrics in traditional Malay outfits, revolutionizing their design and wear. His talent gained recognition among aristocrats in Malaysia and even reached international celebrities such as Michelle Yeoh, Lady Gaga, Estelle, Tori Amos, and many others.</p>
      <p>Bernard Chandran continues to inspire young designers in Malaysia, paving the way for aspiring individuals in a conservative fashion landscape. His influence and talent have earned him numerous accolades, including being conferred the title of Dato (the Malaysian equivalent of a knighthood) by the Sultan of Pahang in 2007 for his outstanding contributions to fashion design. He was even invited to hold a solo exhibition at the prestigious Sultan Abu Bakar Museum, an old palace turned Museum.</p>
